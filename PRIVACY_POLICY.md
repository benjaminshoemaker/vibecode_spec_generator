# Vibe Scaffold Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-01-01

This Privacy Policy explains how Vibe Scaffold (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles
information when you use the VibeCODE Spec Generator application.

## Information We Collect
- **User-provided content:** Chat messages, document inputs, and generated
  outputs you create in the application.
- **Usage data:** Basic technical details such as browser type, operating
  system, and interaction events used to improve the product.
- **Logs and diagnostics:** Error reports and performance data that help us
  maintain reliability.

## How We Use Information
- To operate and improve the multi-step wizard experience.
- To generate AI-powered responses and documents based on your inputs.
- To monitor and protect the security and reliability of the service.

## Data Retention
- Chat history and generated documents are stored in your browser (local
  storage) so you can continue where you left off.
- Server-side logs and diagnostics are retained only as long as needed for
  security, reliability, and debugging.

## Sharing and Third Parties
- We use third-party AI providers (for example, OpenAI via Vercel AI SDK) to
  process prompts and generate content. Your prompts and contextual data may be
  transmitted to these providers to fulfill your requests.
- We do not sell your personal information.

## Security
- We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data.
  No system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Choices
- You may reset the wizard to clear stored chats and documents from your
  browser.
- If you choose to avoid sending sensitive information to third-party AI
  providers, please refrain from entering such data into the chat.

## Children
- The service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
  collect information from them.

## Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy. Material changes will be posted with an updated
  effective date.
