# Vibe Scaffold Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-01-01

This Privacy Policy explains how Vibe Scaffold (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles
information when you use the VibeCODE Spec Generator application.

## Information We Collect
- **User-provided content:** Chat messages, document inputs, and generated
  outputs you create in the application.
- **Email address:** If you voluntarily subscribe to our mailing list, we
  collect your email address to send product updates and announcements.
- **Spec metadata:** When you download generated documents, we collect
  structured metadata extracted from your specs, including: app name, platform
  type, technology stack, complexity tier, and brief summaries of the problem
  statement and target audience. We do **not** store the full document content.
- **Usage data:** Basic technical details such as browser type, operating
  system, and interaction events used to improve the product.
- **Anonymous usage tracking:** We assign a randomly generated anonymous
  identifier (stored in your browser's localStorage) to track usage patterns
  across sessions. This helps us understand retention and how users interact
  with the wizard over time. This identifier is not linked to any personal
  information.
- **Logs and diagnostics:** Error reports and performance data that help us
  maintain reliability.

## How We Use Information
- To operate and improve the multi-step wizard experience.
- To generate AI-powered responses and documents based on your inputs.
- To send product updates and announcements if you subscribe to our mailing list.
- To analyze aggregated spec metadata to understand what types of projects users
  are building and improve our product accordingly.
- To perform cohort analysis and understand user retention patterns using
  anonymous identifiers.
- To monitor and protect the security and reliability of the service.

## Data Retention
- Chat history and generated documents are stored in your browser (local
  storage) so you can continue where you left off.
- Email addresses are retained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list.
- Spec metadata is retained indefinitely for analytics purposes.
- Anonymous usage events are retained indefinitely for cohort analysis.
- Server-side logs and diagnostics are retained only as long as needed for
  security, reliability, and debugging.

## Sharing and Third Parties
- We use third-party AI providers (for example, OpenAI via Vercel AI SDK) to
  process prompts and generate content. Your prompts and contextual data may be
  transmitted to these providers to fulfill your requests.
- We use third-party services for email delivery (Resend) and database hosting
  (Neon/Vercel Postgres) to store mailing list subscriptions and spec metadata.
- We do not sell your personal information.

## Security
- We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data.
  No system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Choices
- You may reset the wizard to clear stored chats and documents from your
  browser.
- You may clear your browser's localStorage to remove the anonymous tracking
  identifier.
- If you choose to avoid sending sensitive information to third-party AI
  providers, please refrain from entering such data into the chat.

## Children
- The service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
  collect information from them.

## Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy. Material changes will be posted with an updated
  effective date.
